Step 1 - Installed Redux- thunk to handle Async calls

STEP 2 - Created Redux store to update quantities, price , cost, total and subtotal data.

Step 3 - I didn't create any new components for this and I have written all the logic in app.js to avoidÂ all unnecessary complexity. It is very easy to understand.
